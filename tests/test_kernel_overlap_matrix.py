"""Tests for the kernel_overlap_matrix skill (Issue #23).

Uses the minimal_nsys_conn and duckdb_conn fixtures from conftest.py.

Test data recap (from conftest.py):
  Stream 7: kernel_A [1-2ms], kernel_B [3-4ms], nccl_ReduceScatter [4.5-5.5ms], kernel_A [8-9ms]
  Stream 8: nccl_AllReduce [2.5-3.5ms]
  Memcpy H2D: [0.1-0.2ms], [0.3-0.4ms], [2.1-2.2ms], [5.1-5.2ms], [23.1-23.4ms]
