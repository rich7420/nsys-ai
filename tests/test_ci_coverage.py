"""What the suite is actually covering, asserted rather than assumed.

A green badge meant "the tests CI could run passed", which is a weaker claim
than it looks and nothing distinguished the two. Concretely, 22 tests across
three files are gated on a 46MB fixture that is not committed: they run on a
developer machine and skip in CI, so CI covers *less* than local and no log
said so. One of them had been failing on main for some time without anyone
noticing, because the only machine that ran it was not the one being watched.

These tests make coverage a property the build checks. They deliberately assert
*reasons* rather than counts — a count is brittle against every new test, while
a new reason means something started skipping that did not before, which is the
event worth catching.
