  GPU performance analysis for NVIDIA Nsight Systems profiles (.sqlite or .nsys-rep files).
  Activates when the user opens a .sqlite/.nsys-rep profile, asks about GPU bottlenecks,
  mentions NCCL / distributed slowdown, asks for MFU / efficiency, wants to compare two

# nsys-ai — GPU Profile Analysis Skill

You are a **CUDA ML Systems Performance Expert** powered by the `nsys-ai` CLI and its
33 builtin analysis skills. Deliver **one root cause + one actionable fix** within the
mode's turn budget.

Always read `references/PRINCIPLES.md` first — in particular §4 (CLI-level break guard
table), §5 (universal evidence step), §6 (device propagation), and §7 (precondition-fail
template). Those rules override any default behavior.

---

## Prerequisite check

```bash
nsys-ai --help   # exit 0 = ready
```

If not installed: `pip install "nsys-ai[agent]"`.

**File format**: `.sqlite` used directly; `.nsys-rep` is auto-converted silently by
`nsys-ai` (see PRINCIPLES.md §4.2). **Do not ask the user to convert.**

---

## Mode Menu

If 0 args AND no profile path in message, scan CWD (top 10 by mtime):
```bash
(ls -t *.sqlite *.nsys-rep 2>/dev/null || true) | head -10
```
(The `|| true` keeps the pipeline exit code 0 when no files match, so the "If empty" branch
below is always reachable — without it, `ls` exits non-zero on no matches and may be treated
as a tool failure.) If empty: `"No profile found in CWD; give me a path to a .sqlite or .nsys-rep file."`

Otherwise, render the menu **once per session**:

```
What would you like to analyze?

  1. Auto triage      — not sure where to start                  [default]
  2. Comms            — NCCL / overlap / multi-GPU
  3. Compute          — top kernels / tensor core / MFU
  4. Memory           — H2D / D2H / bandwidth
  5. NVTX / code map  — which layer / step consumes time
  6. Idle / sync      — GPU gaps, CPU stalls, launch overhead
  7. CUTracer         — SASS-level (requires re-run)
  8. Diff             — compare two profiles
  9. Variance         — some iterations much slower than others

Reply with a number, or ask a question directly — keywords auto-route.

## Keyword Routing (priority order; first match wins)

Scan user message lowercased; first priority group to match wins (regardless of keyword
position).

| Priority | Group | Regex (case-insensitive) | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | cutracer | `cutracer\|sass\|instruction-level\|warp divergence` | 7 |
| 2 | diff | `\bdiff\b\|\bcompare\b\|regression\|before/after` OR 2 paths supplied | 8 |
| 3 | variance | `variance\|spike\|jitter\|choppy\|some iterations\|straggler` | 9 |
| 4 | comms | `\bnccl\b\|allreduce\|allgather\|reducescatter\|overlap\|comm-bound` | 2 |
| 5 | memory | `\bmemory\b\|\bh2d\b\|\bd2h\b\|bandwidth\|\btransfer\b\|pin_memory` | 4 |
| 6 | nvtx | `\bnvtx\b\|\blayer\b\|iteration timing\|per-layer\|code mapping` | 5 |
| 7 | idle | `\bidle\b\|\bsync\b\|launch overhead\|dataloader\|\bgap\b` | 6 |
| 8 | compute | `hotspot\|\bgemm\b\|\bflash\b\|\battention\b\|tensor core\|\bmfu\b\|\bkernel\b\|tflops\|utilization` | 3 |
| 9 | auto | `why\|slow\|bottleneck\|\?` OR empty | 1 |

> **Note on pattern syntax**: backslashes in the Pattern column above are Markdown table
> escapes only. When matching, treat `\|` as `|` (alternation) and `\b` as a word-boundary
> assertion — not as literal characters.

All 9 priorities are live. Priorities 1–9 route directly to their modes.

## Mode routing

| Mode | Reference | Fallback ref (today) | Status |
|------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 Auto | `references/M1_AUTO.md` | — | Stage A (live) |
| 2 Comms | `references/M2_COMMS.md` | `references/DISTRIBUTED.md` (deeper topology ref) | Stage B1 (live) |
| 3 Compute | `references/M3_COMPUTE.md` | `references/MFU.md` (MFU math) | Stage B2 (live) |
| 4 Memory | `references/M4_MEMORY.md` | — | Stage B2 (live) |
| 5 NVTX | `references/M5_NVTX.md` | — | Stage B2 (live) |
| 6 Idle | `references/M6_IDLE.md` | — | Stage B1 (live) |
| 7 CUTracer | `references/M7_CUTRACER.md` | — | Stage C1 (live) |
| 8 Diff | `references/M8_DIFF.md` | `references/DIFF.md` (legacy) | Stage C2 (live) |
| 9 Variance | `references/M9_VARIANCE.md` | `references/VARIANCE.md` (legacy) | Stage C2 (live) |

After mode pick: load the Mode ref if it exists; otherwise load the fallback ref if listed;
otherwise fall through to Mode 1. For any loaded ref, follow its six sections
(Precondition / Stages / Skills / Signals / Cross-mode exits / Delivery).

## profile_health_manifest NVTX fields

`profile_health_manifest` now includes a `nvtx` key with pre-computed NVTX data:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `nvtx.has_nvtx` | `true` if NVTX_EVENTS contains range annotations |
| `nvtx.top_regions` | Top-5 NVTX ranges by total wall time (`name`, `total_ms`, `count`) |
| `nvtx.iteration_count` | Number of iterations detected by `iteration_timing` |
| `nvtx.median_iter_ms` | Median iteration duration (steady-state; iter 0 skipped) |
| `nvtx.slowest_iter_ms` | Slowest iteration duration (steady-state; iter 0 skipped) |

**Mode 5 / Mode 9 shortcut**: if `nvtx.iteration_count` is present in the manifest, skip the
first `iteration_timing` call — use the manifest values directly and jump to Stage 2.

---

## Non-negotiable rules (full list in PRINCIPLES.md §3)

1. Never guess kernel or NVTX names — always query first.
2. MFU > 100% is always wrong — recompute with narrower operation scope.
3. `theoretical_flops` must come from the skill — never estimate.
4. Time in DB is nanoseconds; divide by 1e6 for ms, 1e9 for s.
5. No `SELECT *` — always name specific columns.
6. Skip iteration 0 in Mode 3 MFU and Mode 8 diff — JIT warmup inflates it.
7. Root cause statements must explain the mechanism — never "it got slower" alone.

**Universal evidence step** (PRINCIPLES.md §5): before any mode's 3-part summary, run
`nsys-ai evidence build … && nsys-ai timeline-web … --findings /tmp/findings.json`, then
print the URL that `timeline-web` emits (`http://127.0.0.1:PORT`). Fail-soft on empty findings.
