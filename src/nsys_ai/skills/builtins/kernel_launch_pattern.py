"""Kernel launch pattern analysis.

Goes beyond kernel_launch_overhead (which only measures individual gaps)
to analyze the pattern of kernel dispatches:
- Burst vs trickle launch patterns
- Sync points where GPU goes idle
- Average dispatch rate (kernels/ms)
- Longest gap between launches per stream
