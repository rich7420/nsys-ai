"""Memory bandwidth and utilization analysis.

Analyzes CUDA memory copy operations to compute:
- Per-direction bandwidth (H2D, D2H, D2D, P2P)
- Peak vs sustained bandwidth
- Large transfer identification
- Total bytes moved

Goes beyond the basic memory_transfers skill which only does direction aggregation.
