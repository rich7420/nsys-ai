"""Root cause pattern matcher.

Programmatically detects known GPU performance anti-patterns from
the Book of Root Causes using existing skill data.

Each pattern has:
  - name: canonical root cause name
  - check: function that examines skill outputs and returns match info
  - severity: critical / warning / info
  - recommendation: actionable fix suggestion

This is a Python-level skill that runs other skills internally
to gather evidence, then matches against known patterns.
