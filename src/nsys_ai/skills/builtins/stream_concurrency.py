"""Stream concurrency analysis.

Measures how many GPU streams are executing kernels simultaneously.
True multi-stream concurrency means the GPU can overlap compute
with memory copies or different compute workloads.

This skill answers: "Is the GPU saturated, or are kernels serialized
on a single stream?"
