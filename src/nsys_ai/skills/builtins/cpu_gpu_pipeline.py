"""CPU-GPU pipeline analysis.

Analyzes the relationship between CPU-side kernel dispatch and GPU-side
kernel execution to determine if the CPU is keeping the GPU fed.

Key metrics:
- CPU dispatch lead time: how far ahead is CPU vs GPU
- GPU starvation events: when GPU runs out of queued work
- Per-thread launch contribution: which threads feed the GPU
