"""Arithmetic intensity vs. GPU peak assessment (Roofline Model).

Combines GPU hardware specs with kernel execution time and user-provided
theoretical FLOPs to classify workloads as compute-bound or memory-bound.

Since Nsight Systems .sqlite does NOT contain per-kernel FLOPs or bytes-moved
(only NCU has that), this skill performs an **aggregate roofline estimation**.
