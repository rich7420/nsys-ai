"""Compute/Communication overlap breakdown.

Uses overlap_analysis() from overlap.py to quantify how much GPU compute
overlaps with NCCL communication.  This is a Python-level skill (execute_fn)
rather than a SQL skill because it needs interval merging and intersection
logic that can't be expressed in a single SQL query.
