"""sql_compat.py — SQLite-to-DuckDB SQL dialect translation.

Provides a lightweight query rewriter to handle the few syntax differences
between SQLite and DuckDB.  Today this covers:
  - ``[identifier]`` bracket escaping → ``"identifier"`` double-quote escaping
    (SQLite accepts both; DuckDB only accepts double-quotes or backticks.)

DuckDB natively supports GLOB, LIKE, COALESCE, CAST(... AS INT) and all
window/aggregate functions used in the codebase, so no translation is needed
for those.

    Currently rewrites:
      ``[end]``  →  ``"end"``
      ``[start]`` → ``"start"``
      (any ``[identifier]`` → ``"identifier"``)
      ``0x1000000`` → ``16777216`` (hex literals to decimal)

    .. note::

       The rewriter applies regex substitutions across the raw SQL string.
       It does **not** parse string literals or comments, so a hex literal
       inside a quoted string (e.g. ``WHERE note = '0x10'``) would also be
       rewritten.  In the Nsight Systems domain this never occurs — all hex
       values appear as numeric comparisons — but callers dealing with
       user-supplied string data should be aware of this limitation.
